This Repo is a reimplementation of the paper Incoporate Deep-Transfer-Learning into Automatic 3D Neuron Tracing

The original version is no longer runnable under new Tensorflow version.

Run gen_models to train background network and centerline network

Run transfer to transfer knowledge to a specific dataset
